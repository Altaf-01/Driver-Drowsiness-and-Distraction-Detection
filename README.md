# Driver Drowsiness and Distraction Detection


## Overview

Welcome to the Driver Drowsiness and Distraction Detection repository! This project is dedicated to ensuring road safety by detecting signs of drowsiness and distraction in drivers. The system employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze various facial landmarks and promptly raise an alarm if the driver is detected as drowsy over an extended period.

## Key Features

- **Facial Landmarks Detection:** The model identifies and tracks multiple facial landmarks to analyze the driver's facial expressions and movements.

- **Drowsiness Detection:** Utilizing a CNN, the system assesses the driver's state to detect signs of drowsiness. An alarm is raised if drowsiness persists over a specified time threshold.

- **Real-time Monitoring:** The system operates in real-time, continuously analyzing facial features to provide timely alerts.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Altaf-01/Driver-Drowsiness-and-Distraction-Detection.git
   cd Driver-Drowsiness-and-Distraction-Detection
